# Lab Summary: Installing Python Packages and Running Python Scripts

In this lab, we performed various tasks related to installing required Python packages and running Python scripts. The primary focus was on utilizing packages such as `jdcal`, `astral`, and `geopy` for different purposes. Below is a summary of the lab activities:

1. **Changing Directory**:
   - We navigated to the `iot` directory using the command:
     ```
     $ cd ~/iot
     ```

2. **Running Python Scripts**:
   - We executed several Python scripts using the `python3` command to explore different functionalities:
     - `julian.py`: Likely to calculate Julian dates.
     - `date_example.py`: To work with date objects.
     - `datetime_example.py`: For handling datetime objects.
     - `time_example.py`: Focusing on time-related operations.
     - `sun.py 'New York'`: Probably related to sun-related calculations for New York.
     - `moon.py`: Likely to provide moon-related information.
     - `coordinates.py 'SC Williams Library'`: Expected to fetch coordinates for a location named 'SC Williams Library'.
     - `address.py '40.74480675, -74.02532862031404'`: Possibly intended to find an address for given coordinates.
     - `cpu.py`: Potentially related to monitoring CPU information.
     - `battery.py`: Likely to provide battery-related statistics.
     - `documentstats.py document.txt`: Probably used to analyze statistics of a text document.

3. **Issue with `coordinates.py`**:
   - It was mentioned that there were problems running the `coordinates.py` script. Further details about the issues and error messages encountered would be helpful for troubleshooting.

In summary, this lab involved the installation of Python packages and running a variety of Python scripts to explore different functionalities related to dates, times, celestial bodies, geolocation, hardware, and text analysis. Additional information about the issues faced during the execution of the `coordinates.py` script would be necessary for resolving the problem.
